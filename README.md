### Project Description
NexPlan is a forum-based web platform to manage mentor directories and event records in one place.  
It helps users discover suitable mentors through an AI-style chatbot recommender and derive better event ideas from event history.  
The product focuses on clean, interactive management for forums, mentors, and event insights.

### The Problem statement
Students and forum teams often struggle to quickly identify the right mentor for their goals, while event learnings are scattered and hard to reuse. This causes slow decision-making, repeated mistakes, and low visibility into who can guide what.

### The Solution
NexPlan centralizes forum, mentor, and event data in a single dashboard. It provides a chatbot-driven mentor suggestion flow that ranks mentors by user intent/keywords and keeps event history accessible so teams can generate better ideas from past records.
